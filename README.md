# marketing-analysis

Through data visualization and in-depth analysis, I explored conversion rates, customer engagement, and feedback sentiment trends to uncover actionable insights and opportunities for growth. Here's a snapshot of the key takeaways:

📉 Conversion Rate Trends
• Notable dip to 5.0% in October, but strong recovery in December to 10.2%
• Peak performance in January (18.5%), especially driven by Ski Boots (150% conversion)
• Lowest performance in May, suggesting marketing strategy adjustments are needed

📈 Recommendations to Boost Conversions
• Focus on high-performing products like Kayaks, Ski Boots, and Baseball Gloves
• Leverage seasonal campaigns (e.g., Jan & Sept) to drive conversions
• Optimize conversion funnel by identifying and fixing drop-off points

📉 Customer Engagement Insights
• Overall decline in social media engagement through the year
• Despite low likes/clicks, a solid 15.37% click-through rate from engaged users
• Blog content led in views (April & July), while social and video remained steady

💡 Strategies to Enhance Engagement
• Refresh content strategy with interactive formats & UGC
• Improve CTAs in blog/social posts—especially during low-engagement months (Sept–Dec)

⭐ Customer Feedback Highlights
• Majority of reviews are 4–5 stars, showing overall satisfaction
• Average rating sits at 3.7, just below the 4.0 target
• 82 reviews with negative sentiment indicate improvement areas

🛠 Opportunities for Improvement
• Create a feedback loop to address mixed/negative reviews
• Engage with dissatisfied customers to resolve issues and increase satisfaction
• Focus on products under 3.5 stars for targeted improvement

📊 This project sharpened my skills in data storytelling, business insight extraction, and dashboard design using Power BI.
